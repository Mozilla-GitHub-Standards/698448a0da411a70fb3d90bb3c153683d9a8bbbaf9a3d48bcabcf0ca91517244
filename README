This script will find mentions of "TODO: liberate" (or some variant) in
zamboni, kitsune, and reporter.  Feel free to add other Mozilla projects to the
submodules if you think they should be scanned.

The output is a file, output.ack which lists a snipped of the code that we
think could be of use to the world.

Since the list is fairly small, I've kept the output ugly.  But overtime we
might want to push the documentation to github pages and automate this query
regularly.

## TODO

* push to github pages
* format it all pretty
